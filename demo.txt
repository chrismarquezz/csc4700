What is your favorite movie?
Oppenheimer

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Spain

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Probably teleportation so I can visit home, friends, or anywhere I want at any moment. I also do not have to worry about being late to anything anymore.
